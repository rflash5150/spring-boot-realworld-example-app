# ![RealWorld Example App using Kotlin and Spring](example-logo.png)

> ### Spring boot + MyBatis codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Spring boot + Mybatis including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

# Security

Integration with Spring Security and add other filter for jwt token process.

# Getting started
